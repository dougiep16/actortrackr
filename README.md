# actortrackr
ActorTrackr is an open source web application for storing/searching/linking Actor related data.  The primary sources are from users and various public repositories. Examples of useful repos: APTNotes and "APT Groups and Operations" spreadsheet. Without the hard work of others, this application wouldn't be possible.  We hope to continue the usefulness by improving the search and linking of data stored in the system.

We encourage users to contribute publicly available information here to facilitate sharing and create their own ActorTrackr internally for sensitive data.  If you extend the system and find your changes useful for others, please submit a pull request.
